# Classic GUI for SickRage (former SickBeard)

I love Sickbeard/SickRage development, but lately the UI has been gone sideways in my honest opinion. I liked the way it was. SickBeard original logo is perfect and the green colors were once a bomb. This is my take on SickRage UI.

## Usage

Just clone the repo and replace the files. This causes problems with SickRage updates, but you can easily update with this routine:

	git reset --hard
	git pull

Quick commands for minor theme updates:

    cp ~/SickRage-Classic-gui/gui/slick/interfaces/default/config_general.tmpl ~/SickRage/gui/slick/interfaces/default/config_general.tmpl
    cp ~/SickRage-Classic-gui/gui/slick/interfaces/default/inc_top.tmpl ~/SickRage/gui/slick/interfaces/default/inc_top.tmpl

My own superior SickBeard theme is in development soon enough.
